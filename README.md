# vscoce-dita-snippets
This is a collection of the snippets I use every day to write DITA documents using VSCode. Most of these snippets are meant to emulate (up to some extent) the default behaviour of OxygenXML.

# Usage
Place the xml.json file in VSCode's user snippets folder (C:\users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets). If you already have XML snippets, merge the contents of this file with your existing snippets.
